# First-School-Project
My first school project


This project was created in a three student group on our second term. We had to come up with the idea of the project ourselves. Our project was to create a prototype of a tiny pocketsized gaming console, not unlike the tamagotchi's used to be. We first worked to figure out how to make our arduino screen and all our buttons and stuff to work. After that we each worked our own little game demo to the console, which we then together compiled into one file and crammed in arduino mega.

The code files added are my game demo that I worked on Processing IDE (only one of us at a time could test on arduino, so the other two worked with Processing as it is sort of similar to the arduino IDE library we needed). It's nothing too big, but it's a start, and I had fun creating my simple cat tamagotchi with all randomized looks.
